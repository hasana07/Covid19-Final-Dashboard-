# Goal of the dashboard

The overall goal of the dahsboard was to create an informative visual relating indicators of country socioeconimics to COVID-19. In order to achieve this goal, our group also noted COVID-19 prevalence, mortality rate, and case-fatality rates in 12 chosen countries. The final output consisted of an R-Markdown flexdashboard, which contains interacitve maps along with relevant plots to better help visualize the story we tried to tell with data.
